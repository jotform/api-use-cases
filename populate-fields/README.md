Populate Fields
================================

*View the [populate-fields source](https://github.com/jotform/api-use-cases/tree/master/populate-fields).*


Populate Fields is a small script that generates a url to automatically populate a form's fields with the desired values.
*See it in action [here](http://www.jotform.com/populate-fields).*

This script uses:  
prototype.js for DOM manipulation.  
JotForm's FormPicker Widget (with jQuery) for selecting forms.  
boostrap for making things pretty.
